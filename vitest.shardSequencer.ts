/**
 * Vitest's default sharding sorts test files by a hash of their path and slices that list
 * into equal *file counts* (see `BaseSequencer.shard`). Test files differ by two orders of
 * magnitude in cost, so where a heavy file lands decides a shard's wall clock: shard 5 was
 * running 2x the work of shard 3 on unchanged code, and adding shards did not help because
 * the heavy files still concentrated in one slice.
 *
 * This sequencer instead packs files by measured cost, using the timings CI publishes from
 * each run's blob reports (`scripts/write-unit-test-durations.mjs`). Without a manifest it
 * falls back to the default slices, so a cache miss or a plain local run behaves as before.
