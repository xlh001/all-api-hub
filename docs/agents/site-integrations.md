# Site Integration Guidance

Use the relevant provider sections for site integration tasks, not as a prerequisite for unrelated changes. Provider notes and upstream links are discovery aids; current registration and verified target behavior take precedence.

This repo models site support on three independent axes: account scope, managed-site scope, and adapter family/capabilities. Do not infer one axis from another.

`src/services/accountSiteDefinitions/definitions.ts` is the source of truth for registered site types, scopes, adapter families, onboarding metadata, and product profiles. `src/services/apiAdapters/registry.ts` owns capability dispatch. `src/services/apiService/` contains provider-specific protocol transports used by those adapters. Provider directories and detection rules are not support declarations.

Managed-site capabilities live under `src/services/apiAdapters/managedSites/`; provider-native resources live under `src/services/apiAdapters/managedResources/`. `src/constants/siteType.ts` is a compatibility facade over the definition registry, not a separately maintained site inventory.

When working on a site type:

1. Confirm registration and scope in `src/services/accountSiteDefinitions/identifiers.ts`, `definitions.ts`, and `registry.ts`.
2. Confirm capability dispatch in `src/services/apiAdapters/registry.ts` and the provider-specific adapter. Use `src/services/siteDetection/detectSiteType.ts` only for onboarding and detection behavior.
3. Verify upstream behavior before making definitive claims when backend differences matter.
4. If missing upstream evidence blocks a protocol decision, ask for the target deployment, fork, version, or a redacted trace. State assumptions and continue independent work; do not repeatedly request evidence already supplied.

## Relationships

- **One API (`one-api`)** is the original upstream family. One API/New API-family account types share capability construction under `src/services/apiAdapters/newApi/` and protocol transports under `src/services/apiService/newApiFamily/`.
- **New API (`new-api`)** is a One API downstream family with both account-site and managed-site support.
- **Veloera (`Veloera`)** is downstream of New API and uses the New API family plus Veloera-specific account and managed-site overrides.
- **OneHub (`one-hub`)** is downstream of One API with a substantially different surface.
- **DoneHub (`done-hub`)** is downstream of OneHub and uses New API-family account capabilities plus a dedicated managed-site adapter.
- **AnyRouter (`anyrouter`)** and **WONG公益站 (`wong-gongyi`)** use New API-family capabilities with provider-specific variants and check-in handling; verify the target deployment before describing their exact compatibility.
- **`v-api`** documents its backend as based on One API with some New API functionality; treat it as a One-API derivative/New API-compatible bucket rather than a pure New API fork.
- **`Super-API`, `Rix-Api`, and Neo-API (`neo-Api` in code)** are treated as New API-family variants or compatibility buckets, but their degree of downstream modification varies by deployment and should not be guessed without upstream docs or observed API behavior.
- **Legacy VoAPI (`VoAPI`)** remains a New API-family account compatibility bucket for older deployments. **Current VoAPI (`voapi-v2`)** is account-only and has dedicated adapters under `src/services/apiAdapters/voapiV2/` plus transports under `src/services/apiService/voapiV2/`; do not apply one generation's API assumptions to the other.
- **Octopus (`octopus`)** is managed-only and has dedicated managed-site capabilities plus protocol transports under `src/services/apiService/octopus/`.
- **AxonHub (`axonhub`)** is managed-only and not One-API/New-API compatible; it uses dedicated GraphQL admin integration and native managed-resource adapters.
- **Claude Code Hub (`claude-code-hub`)** is managed-only and not One-API/New-API compatible; it uses dedicated admin/provider and managed-site adapters.
- **Sub2API (`sub2api`)** is both an account site and a managed site. It has dedicated authentication-session, account, model-catalog, key-resource, and managed-resource integrations; it is not a New API-family alias.
- **AIHubMix (`AIHubMix`)** is account-only and uses dedicated capabilities under `src/services/apiAdapters/aihubmix/`. Always use `https://aihubmix.com` as the API origin, including accounts imported from `console.aihubmix.com`. Auto-detect may use logged-in web endpoints (`/call/usr/self`, `/call/usr/tkn`) to obtain the account access token, but saved accounts operate as access-token accounts. Token-authenticated requests send raw `Authorization: <access_token>` without a `Bearer` prefix. Full API keys are one-time secrets; saved key responses may be masked and must not fall back to New API-family secret-resolution behavior.
- **SharedChat (`sharedchat`)** is an account-only integration for the canonical `new.sharedchat.cc` deployment. It uses dedicated cookie-authenticated account, service-credential, invite, and model-catalog capabilities. Treat its observed deployment API as provider-specific; no verified public upstream source repository is currently recorded.
- **RightCode (`RightCode`)** is account-only and not a One API / New API derivative: it runs a provider-owned REST console served on three equivalent domains (`www.right.codes`, `right.codes`, `rightapi.ai`) behind a bearer account token. It covers account balance/plans, native key management, model list and pricing. The deployment has **no check-in flow**, and activation-code redemption is deliberately not integrated because its success payload is unverified. The account token is the API credential itself and expires on the account's own rotation schedule, so access is recovered by re-reading the logged-in browser session rather than by a refresh-token flow.
- **OpenRouter (`openrouter`)** is an account-only platform integration, not a managed/self-hosted backend. It uses Management Keys for account access and provides native API-key resources plus provider-owned model catalogs.

## Default Upstream References

When the user names a backend without a deployment URL or fork, treat these as the default upstream references:

- One API: `https://github.com/songquanpeng/one-api`
- New API: `https://github.com/QuantumNous/new-api`
- Veloera: `https://github.com/Veloera/Veloera`
- V-API: `https://github.com/popjane/v-api`
- Current VoAPI / `voapi-v2`: `https://github.com/VoAPI/VoAPI`; verify legacy `VoAPI` compatibility against the target deployment
- Super-API: `https://github.com/SuperAI-Api/Super-API`
- AnyRouter docs: `https://docs.anyrouter.top/`
- OneHub: `https://github.com/MartialBE/one-hub`
- DoneHub: `https://github.com/deanxv/done-hub`
- Octopus: `https://github.com/bestruirui/octopus`
- AxonHub: `https://github.com/looplj/axonhub`
- Claude Code Hub: `https://github.com/ding113/claude-code-hub`
- Sub2API: `https://github.com/Wei-Shaw/sub2api`
- AIHubMix API docs: `https://docs.aihubmix.com/en/api/Cli` and `https://docs.aihubmix.com/en/api/Models-API`
- SharedChat canonical deployment: `https://new.sharedchat.cc`; no verified public upstream source repository is currently recorded
- RightCode console: `https://www.right.codes` (equivalent aliases `https://right.codes`, `https://rightapi.ai`); docs: `https://docs.rightapi.ai/`; no public upstream source repository (provider-owned REST backend)
- OpenRouter: `https://openrouter.ai/`; docs: `https://openrouter.ai/docs`; OpenAPI source: `https://github.com/OpenRouterTeam/docs/blob/main/openapi/openapi.yaml`

If the reported behavior differs from upstream, distinguish the target deployment from the default reference before concluding the repo is wrong.

## External Backend References in Code

- When implementation behavior depends on external upstream documentation or verified backend behavior, add a concise code comment near the adapter logic that records the source and the specific contract being relied on.
- This is required when the source determines protocol fields, authentication format, unsupported capabilities, compatibility boundaries, one-time secrets, endpoint selection, or deliberate non-fallback behavior.
- Prefer a short URL or upstream repository reference plus the relevant contract summary. Do not add broad comments for ordinary implementation details that are already obvious from local types or tests.
