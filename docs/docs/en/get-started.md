::: warning
If a site has undergone secondary development that alters key interfaces (e.g., `/api/user`), the extension may not be able to add the site correctly.
:::

## 3. Adding a Site

::: info Tip
You must log in to the target website yourself using the browser first. This allows the extension's automatic recognition feature to read your login information and retrieve account details.
:::

### 3.1 Automatic Recognition and Addition

1. Open the main extension page and click `Add Account`

![Add Account Button](../static/image/add-account-btn.png)

2. Enter the proxy station address and click `Auto-Recognize`

![Auto-Recognize Button](../static/image/add-account-dialog-btn.png)

3. After confirming the automatic recognition is correct, click `Confirm Addition`

::: info Tip
The extension will automatically recognize various information about your account, such as:
- Username
- User ID
- [Access Token](#manual-addition)
- Top-up amount ratio
:::

> If the target site has Cloudflare's 5-second protection enabled, the extension will automatically pop up an independent window to assist with bypassing the protection. Once bypassed, the recognition process can continue.
> If the IP quality is poor or for other reasons, you may need to manually complete the protection in the pop-up window before the timeout.

### 3.2 Cloudflare Bypass Assistant Overview

- When Cloudflare's 5-second protection is detected, the extension will automatically launch a temporary window to help complete the verification. If manual intervention is required for the challenge, click to verify within the pop-up window.
- After successful verification, the process will return to the original flow to continue obtaining the Access Token and site information.
- For more details, refer to [Cloudflare Protection and Temporary Window Downgrade](#cloudflare-window-downgrade).

<a id="manual-addition"></a>
### 3.3 Manual Addition

::: info Tip
If automatic recognition fails, you can manually enter site account details. You will need to obtain the following information first. (The UI may vary slightly for each site; please locate them yourself.)
:::
![User Information](../static/image/site-user-info.png)

If the target site is a modified version (e.g., AnyRouter), please switch to **Cookie Mode** when adding the account, and then proceed with automatic recognition or manual input. When encountering sites with strict protection, you can also use the Cloudflare Bypass Assistant. For details, see [FAQ](./faq.md#anyrouter-error).

## 4. Quick Export and Integration

This extension supports exporting added site API configurations to local clients, CLI tools, and self-hosted sites, reducing the effort of repeatedly entering `Base URL`, keys, and model configurations. For a current, complete list, please refer to [Supported Export Tools and Integration Targets](./supported-export-tools.md).

### 4.1 Configuration

Before using the export/integration features, complete the corresponding configurations based on the target type:

- **CherryStudio / CC Switch**: Ensure the target client is available to facilitate importing via Deeplink.
- **Kilo Code / Roo Code**: It is recommended to confirm the model ID corresponding to each key in advance.
- **CLIProxyAPI / Claude Code Router**: Fill in the respective management addresses and credentials in the basic settings.
- **Self-hosted Sites (New API / DoneHub / Veloera / Octopus)**: Complete the backend configuration in `Settings -> Basic Settings -> Self-hosted Site Management`.

### 4.2 Export Process

1. **Navigate to Key Management**: In the extension's **Key Management** page, find the API key for the site you wish to export.
2. **Click Corresponding Action**: In the key action menu, select **"Export to CherryStudio"**, **"Export to CC Switch"**, **"Export Kilo Code JSON"**, **"Import to CLIProxyAPI"**, **"Import to Claude Code Router"**, or **"Import to Current Self-hosted Site"**.
3. **Automatic Handling**:
   * **For CherryStudio / CC Switch**: The extension will automatically transfer site information and API keys according to the target application's Deeplink protocol.
   * **For Kilo Code / Roo Code**: The extension will generate a configurable JSON that can be copied or downloaded for manual import.
   * **For CLIProxyAPI / Claude Code Router / Self-hosted Sites**: The extension will call the corresponding management interface to create or update the Provider / Channel.

Through these integration capabilities, you can synchronize the same upstream site to multiple downstream tools or backend systems without manual copy-pasting.

## 5. Feature Overview

### 5.1 Automatic Refresh and Health Status

- Enable **Settings → Auto Refresh** to activate periodic refreshing of account data. The default interval is 6 minutes (360 seconds), with a minimum supported interval of 60 seconds.
- Checking **"Auto refresh when opening the extension"** will synchronize data when the popup is opened.
- With **"Display Health Status"** enabled, account cards will show health status indicators (Normal/Warning/Error/Unknown).

### 5.2 Check-in Detection

- Check **"Enable Check-in Detection"** in the account information to track site check-in status.
- Supports setting **Custom Check-in URL** and **Custom Top-up URL** to adapt to modified sites.
- Accounts requiring check-in will display a prompt in the list, which can be clicked to jump to the check-in page.

### 5.3 WebDAV Backup and Multi-device Synchronization

- Go to **Settings → WebDAV Backup**, and configure the WebDAV address, username, and password.
- You can choose synchronization strategies (Merge/Upload Only/Download Only) and set the automatic synchronization interval.
- It is recommended to use JSON import/export in conjunction for double backup.

### 5.4 Sorting Priority

- Adjust account sorting logic in **Settings → Sorting Priority Settings**.
- Supports combining conditions such as current site, health status, check-in requirements, and custom fields.
- Drag and drop to adjust priority and disable unwanted sorting rules at any time.

### 5.5 Data Import and Export

- In the **Settings → Data and Backup** section, under "Import and Export," you can export all current account configurations to JSON with one click.
- Supports importing data exported from previous versions or other devices for quick migration or restoration.

### 5.6 New API Model List Synchronization

For detailed documentation on the New API model list synchronization feature, please refer to [New API Model List Synchronization](./new-api-model-sync.md).

### 5.7 New API Channel Management (Beta)

Create/edit/delete channels directly within the extension. Combined with model whitelisting and single-channel synchronization debugging, this can significantly reduce the frequency of back-and-forth operations with the New API backend. Refer to [New API Channel Management](./new-api-channel-management.md) for detailed operations and precautions.

<a id="cloudflare-window-downgrade"></a>
### 5.8 Cloudflare Protection and Temporary Window Downgrade

- When Cloudflare intercepts requests (common status codes 401/403/429), the extension will automatically switch to a temporary window for retries, preserving the target domain's cookies. Generally, no manual operation is required; see [Cloudflare Bypass Assistant](./cloudflare-helper.md) for the underlying principles.
- If a scenario requiring human-machine verification occurs, please complete the challenge in the pop-up assistance window. If failures are frequent, try changing networks or reducing request frequency.
