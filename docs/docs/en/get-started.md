Manual installations do not auto-update like the store build. You can Star / Watch the repository to receive new version notifications.
- **Nightly pre-release**: For early access and testing. It may be less stable than the store build. Nightly is also a manual installation channel and does not auto-update.

- **QQ / 360 etc.**: Supports manual loading in Chromium-based browsers. See the [Manual Installation Guide](./other-browser-install.md).

## 2. Add Your First Account

This is the most crucial step for using the plugin. We **highly recommend using the "Auto-Recognize" feature**, which is as simple as scanning a QR code to log in.

### 2.1 Auto-Recognize (Recommended)

::: tip First Step
Open and log in to your AI proxy station website in your browser first.
:::

1. Click the plugin icon in the top-right corner of your browser to open the main page.
2. Click **`Add Account`**.
3. Enter the URL of the site in the dialog that appears.
4. Click **`Auto-Recognize`**.
5. After confirming the information is correct, click **`Confirm Addition`**.

::: tip Don't have an account yet?
If you are looking for stable, efficient, and highly compatible AI relay services, try our partner [PackyCode](https://www.packyapi.com/register?aff=all-api-hub) (enter the `all-api-hub` promo code during recharge to get 10% off).
:::

> **Shield Bypass Tip**: If the site has Cloudflare verification (5-second shield), the plugin will automatically pop up a window to assist with bypassing it. Once verified, it will continue the recognition process automatically.

<a id="manual-addition"></a>
### 2.2 Manual Addition (Alternative)

If auto-recognition fails, or if you want precise control, you can manually enter the details:
- **Username / ID**: The name displayed on the site.
- **Access Token**: Usually found in the "Settings" or "Tokens" page of the site.
- **Mode Selection**: `Access Token` mode is recommended by default.
