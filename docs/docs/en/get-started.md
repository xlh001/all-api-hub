## 2. Supported Sites

Supports proxy stations deployed based on the following projects:
- [one-api](https://github.com/songquanpeng/one-api)
- [new-api](https://github.com/QuantumNous/new-api)
- [Veloera](https://github.com/Veloera/Veloera)
- [one-hub](https://github.com/MartialBE/one-hub)
- [done-hub](https://github.com/deanxv/done-hub)

- [Super-API](https://github.com/SuperAI-Api/Super-API)

::: warning
If a site has undergone secondary development that alters critical interfaces (e.g., `/api/user`), the extension may not be able to add the site correctly.
:::

## 3. Adding a Site

::: info Tip
You must log in to the target website yourself using the browser first. This allows the extension's automatic recognition feature to read your login information and retrieve account details.
:::

### 3.1 Automatic Recognition and Addition

1. Open the extension's main page and click `Add Account`

![Add Account Button](../static/image/add-account-btn.png)

2. Enter the proxy station address and click `Auto-Recognize`

![Auto-Recognize Button](../static/image/add-account-dialog-btn.png)

3. After confirming the automatic recognition is correct, click `Confirm Addition`

::: info Tip
The extension will automatically recognize various information about your account, such as:
- Username
- User ID
- [Access Token](#manual-addition)
- Top-up amount ratio
:::

> If the target site has Cloudflare's 5-second bypass enabled, the extension will automatically pop up an independent window to assist with bypassing the protection. Once bypassed, the recognition process can continue.
> If the IP quality is poor or for other reasons, you may need to manually complete the bypass within the pop-up window before the timeout.

### 3.2 Cloudflare Bypass Assistant Overview

- When Cloudflare's 5-second bypass is detected, the extension will automatically launch a temporary window to help complete the verification. If human intervention is required for the challenge, click to verify within the pop-up window.
- After successful verification, the process will automatically return to the original flow to continue obtaining the Access Token and site information.
- For more details, refer to [Cloudflare Protection and Temporary Window Downgrade](#cloudflare-window-downgrade).

### 3.3 Manual Addition

::: info Tip
If automatic recognition fails, you can manually enter and add the site account. You will need to obtain the following information first. (The UI may vary for each site, please find it yourself.)
:::
![Site User Info](../static/image/site-user-info.png)

If the target site is a modified version (e.g., AnyRouter), please manually switch to **Cookie Mode** when adding the account, and then perform automatic recognition or manual entry. When encountering sites with strict protection, you can also use the Cloudflare Bypass Assistant in conjunction. For details, see [FAQ](./faq.md#anyrouter-error).

## 4. Quick Export Sites

This extension supports one-click export of added site API configurations to [CherryStudio](https://github.com/CherryHQ/cherry-studio), [CC Switch](https://github.com/ccswitch/ccswitch), and [New API](https://github.com/QuantumNous/new-api), simplifying the process of adding upstream providers in these platforms.

### 4.1 Configuration

Before using the quick export feature, you need to configure the **Server Address**, **Admin Token**, and **User ID** for the target platform (New API) on the extension's **Basic Settings** page.

### 4.2 Export Process

1. **Navigate to Key Management**: In the extension's **Key Management** page, find the API key corresponding to the site you wish to export.
2. **Click Export**: In the key operation menu, select **"Export to CherryStudio / CC Switch / New API"**.
3. **Automatic Processing**:
   * **For New API**: The extension will automatically detect if a channel with the same `Base URL` already exists on the target platform to avoid duplicate additions. If it doesn't exist, a new channel will be created, and the site name, `Base URL`, API key, and available model list will be automatically populated.
   * **For CherryStudio / CC Switch**: The extension will send the site and key directly to the local program or clipboard according to the target application's protocol, eliminating the need for manual copy-pasting.

With this feature, you can easily import API provider configurations into other platforms without manual copy-pasting, significantly improving work efficiency.

## 5. Feature Overview

### 5.1 Automatic Refresh and Health Status

- Open **Settings → Auto Refresh** to enable timed refreshing of account data. The default interval is 6 minutes (360 seconds), with a minimum support of 60 seconds.
- Checking **"Auto-refresh on extension open"** will synchronize data when the pop-up window is opened.
- Enabling **"Show Health Status"** will display health status indicators (Normal/Warning/Error/Unknown) on account cards.

### 5.2 Check-in Detection

- Check **"Enable Check-in Detection"** in the account information to track site check-in status.
- Supports setting **Custom Check-in URL** and **Custom Top-up URL** to adapt to modified sites.
- Accounts requiring check-in will display a prompt in the list, which can be clicked to jump to the check-in page.

### 5.3 WebDAV Backup and Multi-Device Sync

- Go to **Settings → WebDAV Backup** to configure the WebDAV address, username, and password.
- You can choose synchronization strategies (Merge/Upload Only/Download Only) and set the automatic synchronization interval.
- It is recommended to use JSON import/export for double backup.

### 5.4 Sorting Priority

- Adjust the account sorting logic in **Settings → Sorting Priority Settings**.
- Supports combining conditions such as current site, health status, check-in requirements, and custom fields.
- Drag and drop to adjust priority and disable unwanted sorting rules at any time.

### 5.5 Data Import and Export

- In the **Settings → Data & Backup** section under "Import and Export," you can export all current account configurations to JSON with one click.
- Supports importing data exported from older versions or other devices for quick migration or restoration.

### 5.6 New API Model List Synchronization

For detailed documentation on the New API model list synchronization feature, please refer to [New API Model List Synchronization](./new-api-model-sync.md).

### 5.7 New API Channel Management (Beta)

Create/edit/delete channels directly within the extension. Combined with model whitelisting and single-channel sync debugging, this can significantly reduce the frequency of returning to the New API backend. Refer to [New API Channel Management](./new-api-channel-management.md) for detailed operations and precautions.

### 5.8 Cloudflare Protection and Temporary Window Downgrade

- When Cloudflare intercepts requests (common status codes 401/403/429), the extension will automatically switch to a temporary window for retries, maintaining the target domain's cookies. Manual operation is generally not required. For the principle, see [Cloudflare Bypass Assistant](./cloudflare-helper.md).
- If a scenario requires human verification, please complete the challenge in the pop-up assistance window. If it fails frequently, try changing your network or reducing the request frequency.
