# Getting Started

An open-source browser extension designed to optimize the experience of managing accounts for AI proxy hubs like New API. Users can easily centrally manage and view account balances, models, and keys, and automatically add new sites. Supports use on mobile devices via Kiwi or the mobile version of Firefox browser.

## 2. Supported Sites

Supports proxy hubs deployed based on the following projects:
- [one-api](https://github.com/songquanpeng/one-api)
- [new-api](https://github.com/QuantumNous/new-api)
- [Veloera](https://github.com/Veloera/Veloera)
- [one-hub](https://github.com/MartialBE/one-hub)

::: warning
If the site has undergone secondary development causing changes to critical interfaces (such as `/api/user`), the extension may not be able to add the site correctly.
:::

## 3. Adding Sites

::: info Note
You must first log in to the target website using your browser, so that the extension's automatic recognition feature can read your login information and retrieve account details.
:::

### 3.1 Automatic Recognition and Addition

1. Open the extension main page and click `Add Account`

![新增账号](../static/image/add-account-btn.png)

2. Enter the proxy hub address and click `Automatic Recognition`

![自动识别](../static/image/add-account-dialog-btn.png)

3. After confirming the automatic recognition is correct, click `Confirm Addition`

::: info Note
The extension will automatically recognize various information about your account, such as:
- Username
- User ID
- [Access Token](#manual-addition)
- Recharge amount Ratio
:::

> If the target site has enabled Cloudflare's 5-second challenge, the extension will automatically pop up a separate window to help bypass the challenge; once passed, the recognition process can continue.
> If the IP quality is poor or for other reasons, you will need to manually complete the challenge in the pop-up window before timeout.

### 3.2 Cloudflare Challenge Bypass Assistant Overview

- When a Cloudflare 5-second challenge is detected, the extension will automatically launch a temporary window to help complete the verification; if the challenge requires manual intervention, simply click verify within the pop-up.
- After successful verification, it will automatically return to the original process to continue fetching the Access Token and site information.
- For more details, refer to [Cloudflare Protection and Temporary Window Downgrade](#cloudflare-window-downgrade).

### 3.3 Manual Addition

::: info Note
If automatic recognition fails, you can manually input and add the site account. You need to obtain the following information first. (The UI may vary for each site; please locate the information yourself.)
:::
![用户信息](../static/image/site-user-info.png)

If the target site is a modified version (e.g., AnyRouter), please manually switch to **Cookie Mode** when adding the account, and then perform automatic recognition or manual entry. When encountering sites with strict protection, you can also use it in conjunction with the Cloudflare Challenge Bypass Assistant. For details, see [FAQ](./faq.md#anyrouter-error).

## 4. Quick Site Export

This extension supports one-click export of added site API configurations to [CherryStudio](https://github.com/CherryHQ/cherry-studio), [CC Switch](https://github.com/ccswitch/ccswitch), and [New API](https://github.com/QuantumNous/new-api), simplifying the process of adding upstream providers on these platforms.

### 4.1 Configuration

Before using the quick export feature, you need to configure the target platform's (New API) **Server Address**, **Admin Token**, and **User ID** in the extension's **Basic Settings** page.

### 4.2 Export Process

1. **Navigate to Key Management**: On the extension's **Key Management** page, find the API key corresponding to the site you want to export.
2. **Click Export**: In the key operation menu, select **“Export to CherryStudio / CC Switch / New API”**.
3. **Automatic Processing**:
   * **For New API**: The extension automatically checks if a Channel with the same `Base URL` already exists on the target platform to prevent duplicate additions. If it does not exist, a new Channel will be created, and the site name, `Base URL`, API key, and list of available models will be automatically populated.
   * **For CherryStudio / CC Switch**: The extension will send the site and key directly to the local application or clipboard, according to the target application's protocol, eliminating the need for item-by-item pasting.

Through this feature, you can easily import API provider configurations to other platforms without manual copy-pasting, improving work efficiency.

## 5. Feature Quick Look

### 5.1 Automatic Refresh and Health Status

- Go to **Settings → Automatic Refresh** to enable timed account data refresh, with a default interval of 6 minutes (360 seconds), supporting a minimum of 60 seconds.
- Check **“Automatically refresh when opening the extension”** to synchronize data when the pop-up is opened.
- When **“Show Health Status”** is enabled, the account card will display a health status indicator (Normal/Warning/Error/Unknown).

### 5.2 Check-in Detection

- Check **“Enable Check-in Detection”** in the account information to track the site's check-in status.
- Supports setting **Custom Check-in URL** and **Custom Recharge URL** to adapt to modified sites.
- Accounts requiring check-in will display a prompt in the list; clicking it will jump to the check-in page.

### 5.3 WebDAV Backup and Multi-device Synchronization

- Go to **Settings → WebDAV Backup** to configure the WebDAV address, username, and password.
- You can select the synchronization strategy (Merge/Upload Only/Download Only) and set the automatic synchronization interval.
- It is recommended to use this in conjunction with JSON import/export for double backup.

### 5.4 Sorting Priority

- Adjust the account sorting logic in **Settings → Sorting Priority Settings**.
- Supports combining conditions such as current site, health status, check-in requirement, and custom fields.
- Drag and drop to adjust priority, and disable unnecessary sorting rules at any time.

### 5.5 Data Import and Export

- In the “Import and Export” area under **Settings → Data and Backup**, you can export all current account configurations as JSON with one click.
- Supports importing data exported from older versions or other devices, facilitating quick migration or recovery.

### 5.6 New API Model List Synchronization

For detailed documentation on the New API model list synchronization feature, please refer to [New API Model List Synchronization](./new-api-model-sync.md).

### 5.7 New API Channel Management (Beta)

Create/edit/delete Channels directly within the extension. Combined with model whitelisting and single-Channel synchronization debugging, this can significantly reduce the frequency of navigating back and forth to the New API backend. See [New API Channel Management](./new-api-channel-management.md) for detailed operations and precautions.

### 5.8 Cloudflare Protection and Temporary Window Downgrade

- When recognition or API calls are intercepted by Cloudflare (common status codes 401/403/429), the system automatically switches to a temporary window to retry, maintaining the target domain's Cookie. Manual operation is usually not required; the principle is detailed in [Cloudflare Challenge Bypass Assistant](./cloudflare-helper.md).
- If human verification is required, please complete the challenge in the pop-up assistance window; if failures are frequent, try changing your network or reducing the request frequency.
