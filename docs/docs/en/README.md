## Introduction

In the AI era, many of us keep multiple relay-site accounts to save money or try different models. Managing them quickly becomes painful: balances are scattered, pricing is messy, and daily manual check-ins are easy to miss.

**All API Hub is built to solve those problems.** It is your AI asset center, making management simpler, clearer, and more automated.

## 🎯 Use Cases

### 👤 I am a regular AI user (recommended for beginners)

- **How do I start?**: [Download and install the extension](./get-started.md) -> [Add my first account](./get-started.md#add-site)
- **I want to save money**: [Earn credits with auto check-in](./auto-checkin.md) -> [Compare model prices across sites](./model-list.md)
- **I want less manual work**: [See asset changes at a glance](./balance-history.md) -> [Sync accounts to other AI tools](./get-started.md#quick-export-sites)

### 🛠️ I am an advanced user (Key collector)

- **Key management**: [Save standalone URL+Key pairs to the API Credential Library](./api-credential-profiles.md)
- **Availability testing**: [Batch verify API and CLI compatibility](./web-ai-api-check.md)
- **Cross-device sync**: [Configure encrypted WebDAV backup](./webdav-sync.md)

### 👑 I am a site admin (operator area)

- **Efficiency tools**: [Manage channels inside the extension](./self-hosted-site-management.md) -> [Batch sync models](./managed-site-model-sync.md)
- **Configuration optimization**: [Set up model redirection](./model-redirect.md)
- **Security safeguards**: [Handle 2FA / OTP verification](./new-api-security-verification.md)

## 🧩 Supported Site Architectures

No matter which architecture you use, there is a good chance we support it:

- **Account-site compatible architectures**: One API, New API, Veloera, One-Hub, Done-Hub, Sub2API, and more.
- **Specialized account platforms and compatible implementations**: AIHubMix, AnyRouter, Neo-API, Super-API, v-api, and more.
- **Self-hosted admin backends**: New API, Veloera, Done-Hub, [Octopus](https://github.com/bestruirui/octopus), AxonHub, Claude Code Hub, and more, for channel management, migration, and partial model sync.

> If you use Safari on macOS, read the [Safari Installation Guide](./safari-install.md) first.
> If you use QQ Browser, 360 Browser, Brave, Vivaldi, Opera, or similar browsers, read the [Other Browser Installation Guide](./other-browser-install.md).
