## Introduction

The AI ecosystem now has an increasing number of aggregation relay stations and self-built panels based on the New API series. Managing the balances, model lists, and API keys of various sites simultaneously is often fragmented and time-consuming.

All API Hub, as a browser extension, can automatically identify accounts on these sites and provide one-click viewing of balances, management of models and keys, and automatic check-ins. It also offers tools like model synchronization and channel management for self-built New APIs. Currently, it supports accounts from relay stations based on the following projects:

- [one-api](https://github.com/songquanpeng/one-api)
- [new-api](https://github.com/QuantumNous/new-api)
- [Veloera](https://github.com/Veloera/Veloera)
- [one-hub](https://github.com/MartialBE/one-hub)
- [done-hub](https://github.com/deanxv/done-hub)
