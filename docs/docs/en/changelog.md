You can directly jump to the relevant configuration page, reducing the situation where you discover missing configurations only after clicking auto-configure.
  - Hosted Site Verification: The `New API` verification dialog has been changed to an `OTP` style more suitable for CAPTCHA input, making it more convenient to enter one-time verification codes.
  - API Verification Records: Verification history status is now displayed more clearly. When viewing the last verification result in `API Credentials`, Model List, or other locations, it's easier to determine the current status.
  - Hosted Site Settings: Administrator User IDs are now restricted to pure numbers only. Invalid values will be directly intercepted and prompted on the settings page, reducing verification or read exceptions caused by incorrect values.
  - Model List: When no data source is selected, clearer empty state descriptions and next steps are provided, reducing confusion about what to do first after entering the page.
  - Key Management: When there are no keys under an account or key loading fails, clearer empty state prompts are provided, along with options to retry or navigate to relevant pages.
  - Model to Key Dialog: You can now directly jump to the `Key Management` for the corresponding account and quickly filter by account badges to identify the source. This makes it easier to troubleshoot models and keys for a specific account.
  - Update Reminders: Users who manually install packages can now view the differences between the current version and the latest stable version, and directly open the download page or update notes, reducing the chance of staying on an old version unknowingly for extended periods.
- **Experience Optimizations:**
  - In-Page Navigation: For multiple entry points that require jumping from the current flow to the settings, account, or hosted site pages, navigation history is now better preserved, making returning to the previous step more natural.
  - Exit Flow Prompts: Button copy will more clearly distinguish between "Leave Current Flow" and "Continue to Next Step," reducing accidental clicks that lead to leaving the current page.
  - Warning Prompts: Some scenarios described as "partially successful / requires subsequent processing" are now displayed with a unified warning prompt style, accompanied by directly executable follow-up actions.
  - Account Data Reading: Manually fetching account data that takes longer than approximately `20` seconds will now stop, preventing prolonged waiting and preserving any results that can still be saved, reducing instances of being stuck in a waiting state.
- **Bug Fixes:**
  - WebDAV Sync: Before automatic synchronization, the system will make its best effort to upload local changes for deleted accounts, reducing the chance of deleted accounts being reintroduced in other devices or subsequent synchronizations.
  - Account Management: Temporary windows will only be suggested to assist the process when the current environment is genuinely restricted, reducing false alarms.
  - Model List: Restored the original account name badge display, making it easier to identify which account a model originates from when viewing account-sourced models.

## 3.32.0
- **New Features:**
  - Automatic Check-in: Each row in the results table can now open its corresponding site directly. If the current site type does not support automatic check-in, the extension now shows a clearer message so you can decide whether to handle it manually or check the site's rules first.
  - New API Hosted Site Verification: If verification finds that `Base URL`, username, or password is missing, you can now fill them in directly inside the verification dialog and continue with `Save and Retry`, without leaving the dialog to go back to the settings page.
- **Experience Optimizations:**
  - Account List Sorting: The default sort priority now gives precedence to the field you actively choose in the list. For example, when sorting by `Balance`, `Spend`, or `Income`, that selection now takes effect before the old manual order. Existing preferences are migrated automatically, so no reconfiguration is required.
- **Bug Fixes:**
  - Account Management: When cookie import runs into missing permissions, the account dialog no longer closes early when redirecting you to `Permission Settings`; after handling permissions, you can continue the current input flow.
  - Automatic Recognition: If the current tab was already open before the extension was installed or updated, automatic recognition now clearly prompts you to refresh the page and provides a one-click refresh action, reducing failures that looked random.
  - Temporary Page / Window Flows: Fixed cases where context was released too early in flows that rely on temporary pages, reducing mid-process failures, closed-page issues, and errors like `No tab with id`.

  - Model List: When the model list for a single account fails to load, you can now use an `API Key` from that account to continue loading, reducing the situation where models are completely invisible due to API exceptions.
  - CLIProxyAPI: Added `Connection Detection` in `CLIProxyAPI Settings`. It can automatically check after saving the address or managing keys, or you can manually re-detect.
- **Experience Optimizations:**
  - Hosted Site Channel Import: Clearer prompts will be shown before importing to indicate if the current channel might be a duplicate, reducing the need for post-import investigation.
  - Hosted Site Channel Import: When confirmation is needed, you can now complete verification in the dialog box before proceeding to check for duplicates, without directly blocking the operation.
  - Export to Channel: If models cannot be fetched, the channel dialog will still open normally, prompting you to fill them in manually, rather than interrupting the process due to automatic loading failure.
  - Account Cookie Import: Now distinguishes between reasons like "current site has no readable cookies," "missing cookie permission," and "read failure." When permissions are missing, a prompt will appear in the account dialog, with a direct link to the permission settings page.
  - Channel Management: The channel list now defaults to displaying the most recent records first, making newly created or recently added channels easier to find.
  - Automatic Check-in: Accounts with the `Skipped` status will be moved to the end, making it easier to see frequently used and pending accounts.

  - Auto Refresh: The minimum refresh interval is now 60 seconds, and the minimum refresh interval protection is now 30 seconds. Old configurations will be automatically corrected to a valid range after updating, and related prompts and documentation have been improved.

::: warning Important: Auto-refresh configuration will be forcibly adjusted
Due to feedback indicating that **overly short auto-refresh intervals can trigger site rate limits and place excessive load on sites**,

v3.15.0 **has forcibly modified auto-refresh configurations**:
- Auto-refresh and refresh on plugin open features have been turned off. If you still need to enable them, you must re-enable them manually.
- The minimum `Refresh Interval` is now 60 seconds, and the `Minimum Refresh Interval Protection` is now 30 seconds. If your pre-upgrade setting was below these thresholds, it will be automatically raised to the minimum value after upgrading. If your previous setting was within the new valid range, it will remain unaffected.
