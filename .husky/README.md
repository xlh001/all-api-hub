# Git Hooks

This project uses [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/) to manage Git hooks and ensure code quality before commits and pushes.

## Configured Hooks

### pre-commit
Runs before each commit to ensure code quality:
- **Unified staged validation**: Runs `pnpm run validate:staged`
  - Internally runs `pnpm lint-staged --concurrent false` to format staged source and script files, apply ESLint fixes, and run `vitest related --run` for staged JS/TS files
  - Then runs `pnpm run i18n:check:staged` as a repo-level guard
  - The i18n guard only triggers when staged files touch `src/**`, `package.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, or `i18next.config.ts`
  - Internally the i18n guard runs `pnpm run i18n:extract:ci` to ensure locale files stay in sync with code

### pre-push
Runs before each push to catch repository-wide issues that staged-file checks can miss:
- **Push validation**: Runs `pnpm compile`
  - This catches TypeScript regressions locally before the push reaches CI

## Manual Commands

You can also run these checks manually:

```bash
# Format code
pnpm format

# Check formatting without fixing
pnpm format:check

# Run linter
pnpm lint

# Fix linting issues
pnpm lint:fix

# Run full i18n extract CI guard
pnpm run i18n:extract:ci

# Run the full staged pre-commit-equivalent validation manually
pnpm run validate:staged

# Run the pre-push type check manually
pnpm compile

# Run only the staged i18n guard manually
pnpm run i18n:check:staged

```

## Skipping Hooks (Not Recommended)

In rare cases where you need to skip hooks:

```bash
# Skip pre-commit hook
git commit --no-verify

# Skip pre-push hook
git push --no-verify
```

⚠️ **Warning**: Skipping hooks is not recommended as it bypasses quality checks. Only do this if you have a valid reason and understand the consequences.

## Troubleshooting

### Hooks not running
If hooks are not running after cloning the repository:

```bash
pnpm install
```

This will trigger the `prepare` script which sets up Husky.

### Permission issues
If you get permission errors:

```bash
chmod +x .husky/pre-commit
chmod +x .husky/pre-push
```
