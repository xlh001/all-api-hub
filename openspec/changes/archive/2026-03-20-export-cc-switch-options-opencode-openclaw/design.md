## Context

The current CC Switch export flow is already centralized and reused across multiple surfaces:

- `src/services/integrations/ccSwitch.ts`: reuse and extend as the single source of truth for supported CC Switch app ids, deeplink validation, and URL generation.
- `src/components/CCSwitchExportDialog.tsx`: reuse and extend for the app selector, default endpoint behavior, and shared submit flow.
- `src/features/KeyManagement/components/TokenList.tsx`, `src/features/ApiCredentialProfiles/components/ApiCredentialProfilesDialogs.tsx`, and `src/features/AccountManagement/components/CopyKeyDialog/index.tsx`: reuse unchanged because they already mount the shared dialog.
- `src/features/ApiCredentialProfiles/utils/exportShims.ts`: reuse unchanged because it already adapts profile data into the `(account, token)` shape required by the shared dialog.
- `tests/utils/ccSwitch.test.ts` and `tests/components/CCSwitchExportDialog.test.tsx`: extend existing focused coverage instead of introducing a new test harness.

The gap is narrow but cross-cutting: `CCSWITCH_APPS` currently hard-codes only `claude`, `codex`, and `gemini`, and the dialog label switch only renders those values. Issue #632 asks for `opencode` and `openclaw`, and upstream CC Switch now advertises and handles those app identifiers in its deeplink import path.

## Goals / Non-Goals

**Goals:**

- Add `opencode` and `openclaw` to the shared CC Switch export app list.
- Keep all existing CC Switch export entry points aligned by extending shared abstractions rather than branching per surface.
- Preserve deeplink payload structure and secret-handling guarantees while making the new targets selectable.
- Define predictable default endpoint behavior for the new app ids so users can export with minimal manual editing.

**Non-Goals:**

- Creating a separate export dialog for specific entry points or app families.
- Changing the broader quick-export menu structure or adding new export targets beyond CC Switch.
- Reworking model fetching, token resolution, or unrelated CC Switch payload fields.
- Introducing remote protocol negotiation with CC Switch; this change assumes the current upstream app ids remain valid.

## Decisions

### Decision: Extend the shared `CCSWITCH_APPS` union instead of adding per-surface option lists

`src/services/integrations/ccSwitch.ts` already gates valid app identifiers via `CCSWITCH_APPS` and `CCSwitchApp`, while `CCSwitchExportDialog` renders the selector from that list. Extending this shared union keeps runtime validation, TypeScript exhaustiveness, and UI options synchronized.

Alternative considered:

- Keep local option arrays in the dialog and widen validation separately. Rejected because it duplicates the protocol contract and makes future app additions error-prone.

### Decision: Keep using the existing shared export dialog for Key Management, Account Management, and API credential profiles

All current CC Switch entry points eventually render `CCSwitchExportDialog`, and profile exports already adapt into the dialog's existing `(account, token)` contract through `exportShims.ts`. Reusing that dialog ensures the new options appear consistently everywhere with one implementation change.

Alternative considered:

- Fork dialog variants for token exports versus profile exports. Rejected because the data shape is already normalized and a split would create unnecessary drift in app labels, endpoint logic, and validation.

### Decision: Treat endpoint defaults as app-aware, with `codex` retaining `/v1` coercion and `opencode`/`openclaw` defaulting to the stored base URL

The current dialog already special-cases `codex` by coercing the base URL to `/v1`. Upstream CC Switch's additive-mode provider handling for `opencode` and `openclaw` accepts a direct `baseUrl`/endpoint mapping rather than requiring a Codex-style TOML provider block, so the safest default is to preserve the stored account base URL for those new targets and continue allowing manual override.

Alternative considered:

- Force `/v1` for every OpenAI-compatible-looking target. Rejected because that can over-normalize deployments that intentionally expose a different path and would diverge from the upstream `opencode` / `openclaw` import handling.

### Decision: Warn users instead of pretending CC Switch can configure these app-specific API formats through external import

Upstream CC Switch currently exposes richer type-selection controls in its own UI for OpenCode and OpenClaw, but the current external import path still cannot configure those app-specific AI service API formats from All API Hub. Because All API Hub cannot fix that upstream capability gap on its own, the correct local behavior is to keep the export entry point available while showing an explicit warning that users still need to adjust the API format inside CC Switch after import.

Alternative considered:

- Hide or remove the `opencode` / `openclaw` export targets entirely. Rejected because the default import path is still useful, and the user explicitly asked to keep the targets while warning about the limitation.

### Decision: Expand the existing focused tests and locale keys instead of relying on manual verification

The repo already has dedicated utility tests for `openInCCSwitch` and component tests for `CCSwitchExportDialog`. Extending those tests to cover new app ids and endpoint defaults is the smallest reliable validation surface. The dialog also reads app labels from i18n keys, so the locale namespace must be extended in place rather than hard-coding new strings.

Alternative considered:

- Rely only on manual dialog verification because the change looks small. Rejected because the change affects both runtime validation and UI rendering, and the existing test seams are already in place.

## Risks / Trade-offs

- [Upstream CC Switch changes app ids or adds app-specific required fields later] -> Keep app ids centralized in `ccSwitch.ts`, surface limitations in UI copy, and cover the deeplink app parameter explicitly in tests so later protocol updates stay localized.
- [Users assume OpenCode/OpenClaw imports configure the needed AI service API format automatically] -> Show an app-specific warning in the export dialog that states CC Switch does not support configuring that format through external import and points users to adjust it in CC Switch after import.
- [The chosen default endpoint for `opencode` or `openclaw` is not ideal for every deployment] -> Preserve manual endpoint editing in the dialog and avoid locking users into an irreversible transformation.
- [UI labels and validation drift apart] -> Drive the selector from the shared app union and extend locale-backed tests so missing labels or invalid ids fail early.

## Migration Plan

No storage or backup migration is required. This is an additive UI/service change:

1. Extend the shared CC Switch app union and label mapping.
2. Apply any app-specific default-endpoint rule in the existing dialog.
3. Update locale resources and focused tests.
4. Keep the warning copy in sync with upstream CC Switch deeplink behavior as that protocol evolves.

Rollback is straightforward: remove the new app ids from the shared union and label mapping if interoperability issues are found.

## Open Questions

- No blocker remains for this repo. Full provider-type preservation for OpenCode/OpenClaw still depends on future CC Switch upstream deeplink support.
