# key-management-managed-site-channel-status Specification

## Purpose
Define requirements for showing managed-site channel status in Key Management, including automatic refresh behavior, invalidation rules, and secret-safe status feedback.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Key Management shows managed-site verification status and review signals for each loaded key
The system MUST display a managed-site channel status for each token rendered in Key Management when the currently configured managed-site provider supports reliable base-URL channel lookup for review/navigation flows.

When the active managed-site provider does not support reliable base-URL channel lookup, the system MUST suppress per-token managed-site status badges, signal badges, and channel review links, and MUST rely on page-level unsupported guidance instead of token-level verification output.

The status model MUST distinguish at least these outcomes:

- `added`
- `not added`
- `unknown`

When verification reaches the shared resolver, the system MUST capture and expose assessment metadata that includes:

- normalized search base URL and whether backend search completed
- URL-bucket evidence for the normalized `base_url`
- key evidence as `matched`, `no-key-provided`, `comparison-unavailable`, or `no-match`
- model evidence inside the normalized URL bucket ranked as:
  1. Exact normalized model-set equality
  2. Containment in either direction after normalization and de-duplication
  3. Similarity at or above the configured model-similarity threshold

The system MUST reserve `added` for tokens whose key evidence matches and whose model evidence is exact on the same channel.

The system MUST reserve `not added` for search-complete cases where no URL, key, or model signal was found and the token still had a non-empty comparable key.

All other verification-complete states that contain any URL, key, or model signal MUST resolve to `unknown` and require review.

When assessment metadata exists, the rendered Key Management row MUST:

- show URL, key, and model badges with tooltips derived from the assessment
- open channel management by `channelId=<id>` only for `added`
- otherwise provide a review affordance that opens channel management with `search=<searchBaseUrl>`

**Definition.** Login-assist credentials are the New API managed-site authentication credentials including username, password, and an optional TOTP secret used for session-assisted verification flows.

When the status resolves to `unknown` with reason `exact-verification-unavailable` for `new-api`, the rendered row MUST keep the `unknown` status until a retry completes and MUST expose localized verification-recovery guidance.

If the configured New API login-assist credentials include non-empty `username` and `password` values, with TOTP/2FA-assist fields treated as optional additional fields, the row MUST expose a row-level action that starts verification-assisted retry for the affected token.

If either required New API login-assist credential field (`username` or `password`) is missing or empty, the row MUST keep the `unknown` status, MUST expose localized guidance, and MUST expose an action that opens the New API login credential configuration flow before retrying exact verification. The action label and tooltip MUST make it clear that `username` and `password` are required while TOTP/2FA-assist fields remain optional.

- **AND** the managed-site type is `new-api`
- **AND** the row exposes the verification-assisted retry action
- **WHEN** verification-assisted retry encounters a network or service failure before exact verification completes
- **THEN** the row MUST keep the `unknown` status with reason `exact-verification-unavailable`
- **AND** the UI MUST surface a localized transient error
- **AND** the row MUST continue to offer the verification-assisted retry action for that token
- **AND** the system MUST NOT require a full-page reload

#### Scenario: Verification-assisted retry completes but exact verification remains unavailable
- **GIVEN** a token is rendered in Key Management with status `unknown`
- **AND** the reason is `exact-verification-unavailable`
- **AND** the managed-site type is `new-api`
- **AND** the row exposes the verification-assisted retry action
- **WHEN** verification-assisted retry completes but the refreshed token status still resolves to `unknown` with reason `exact-verification-unavailable`

- **AND** the row MUST keep the `unknown` status
- **AND** the UI MUST surface a persistent-failure message that explains exact verification is still unavailable

#### Scenario: Managed-site configuration is missing
- **GIVEN** a token is rendered in Key Management
- **AND** managed-site admin configuration is missing or invalid
- **WHEN** the system determines the token's managed-site channel status
- **THEN** the system shows the token status as `unknown`
- **AND** the reason is `config-missing`

#### Scenario: Veloera suppresses per-token status UI and short-circuits verification
- **GIVEN** a token is rendered in Key Management
- **AND** the managed-site type is `Veloera`
- **WHEN** the system determines whether managed-site verification is available for that token
- **THEN** the system does not show per-token managed-site status badges, signal badges, or review links for that token
- **AND** the system does not attempt the shared base-URL search flow for that token
- **AND** any defensive token-status resolution is classified as `unknown` with reason `veloera-base-url-search-unsupported`

#### Scenario: Backend search fails unexpectedly
- **GIVEN** a token is rendered in Key Management
- **AND** managed-site admin configuration is valid
- **AND** the active managed-site provider supports reliable base-url channel lookup
- **WHEN** backend search does not return a usable result
- **THEN** the system shows the token status as `unknown`
- **AND** the reason is `backend-search-failed`

#### Scenario: Comparable channel inputs cannot be prepared
- **GIVEN** a token is rendered in Key Management
- **AND** managed-site admin configuration is valid
- **AND** the active managed-site provider supports reliable base-url channel lookup
- **WHEN** input preparation fails or omits required comparable base URL or models data
- **THEN** the system shows the token status as `unknown`
- **AND** the reason is `input-preparation-failed`

### Requirement: Status checks run automatically and support manual refresh
The system MUST begin managed-site status checks for the tokens in the current Key Management selection after their token inventory is available when the active managed-site provider supports reliable base-URL channel lookup for review/navigation flows.

The system MUST provide a page-level manual refresh action that reruns managed-site status checks for the current Key Management selection when the active managed-site provider supports reliable base-URL channel lookup for review/navigation flows.

The system MUST reuse in-memory status results for unchanged tokens until a refresh or invalidation event occurs.

The system MUST use bounded concurrency for bulk status checks so the managed-site backend is not flooded with one request per rendered token at once.

When the active managed-site provider does not support reliable base-URL channel lookup, the system MUST skip automatic status checks, MUST suppress the managed-site status refresh action, and MUST show localized page-level guidance that the verification flow is unsupported for that provider.

#### Scenario: Status checks start after token inventory loads
- **GIVEN** Key Management finishes loading token inventory for the current selection
- **AND** the active managed-site provider supports reliable base-url channel lookup
- **WHEN** the token list is rendered
- **THEN** the system begins managed-site status checks for those tokens without requiring the user to start an import flow

#### Scenario: Manual refresh reruns current-selection checks
- **GIVEN** Key Management is showing managed-site status results for the current selection
- **AND** the active managed-site provider supports reliable base-url channel lookup
- **WHEN** the user triggers the refresh action for managed-site status checks
- **THEN** the system reruns status checks for the tokens in the current selection
- **AND** the system replaces the prior results with the refreshed results when the rerun completes

#### Scenario: Unchanged tokens reuse cached results in the current session
- **GIVEN** a token already has a completed managed-site status result in the current Key Management session
- **AND** the token data and managed-site configuration have not changed
- **WHEN** Key Management rerenders without a refresh or invalidation event
- **THEN** the system reuses the existing managed-site status result for that token

#### Scenario: Veloera selection shows unsupported guidance instead of running checks
- **GIVEN** Key Management finishes loading token inventory for the current selection
- **AND** the active managed-site provider is `Veloera`
- **WHEN** the page renders its managed-site status controls
- **THEN** the system does not start managed-site status checks for the current selection
- **AND** the system does not show a managed-site status refresh action
- **AND** the page shows localized guidance that managed-site channel verification is unsupported for Veloera

### Requirement: Status results stay in sync with token and managed-site changes
The system MUST invalidate affected managed-site status results when local token state or managed-site configuration changes could make those results stale.

When the active managed-site provider changes to one that does not support reliable base-URL channel lookup, the system MUST clear previously rendered per-token managed-site status results and switch to the unsupported guidance state instead of rerunning verification checks.

#### Scenario: Successful managed-site import refreshes the affected token
- **GIVEN** a token is shown with managed-site status `not added` or `unknown`
- **WHEN** the user successfully imports that token to the managed site from Key Management
- **THEN** the system invalidates the cached managed-site status for that token
- **AND** the system refreshes the token's managed-site status without requiring a full-page reload

#### Scenario: Token edits or deletion invalidate prior status
- **GIVEN** a token already has a managed-site status result
- **WHEN** the token is edited or deleted in Key Management
- **THEN** the system invalidates the affected managed-site status result
- **AND** the system does not continue to show the stale result as final

#### Scenario: Managed-site preference changes invalidate prior results for supported providers
- **GIVEN** one or more tokens already have managed-site status results
- **AND** the updated managed-site provider supports reliable base-url channel lookup
- **WHEN** the managed-site type or managed-site admin configuration changes
- **THEN** the system invalidates the affected managed-site status results
- **AND** the system reruns managed-site status checks before showing refreshed final results

#### Scenario: Managed-site preference changes to Veloera clear prior results
- **GIVEN** one or more tokens already have managed-site status results
- **WHEN** the managed-site type changes to `Veloera`
- **THEN** the system clears the affected per-token managed-site status results
- **AND** the system stops showing token-level managed-site verification output
- **AND** the page shows localized guidance that managed-site channel verification is unsupported for Veloera

### Requirement: Status feedback does not expose secrets
The system MUST NOT include raw token keys, managed-site admin tokens, or other plaintext credentials in managed-site status labels, explanations, error messages, toasts, or logs emitted for this feature.

#### Scenario: Verification failure is reported without secret leakage
- **GIVEN** a managed-site status check fails while processing a token
- **WHEN** the system reports the failure to the user or records diagnostics for the feature
- **THEN** the reported output omits the raw token key and managed-site credentials
